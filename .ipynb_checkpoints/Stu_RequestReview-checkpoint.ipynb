And that is that we are now some 300 delegates behind Vice President Biden, and the path toward victory is virtually impossible. So while we are winning the ideological battle, and while we are winning the support of so many young people and working people throughout the country, I have concluded that this battle for the Democratic nomination will not be successful. And so today, I am announcing the suspension of my campaign. Please know that I do not make this decision lightly. In fact, it has been a very difficult and painful decision. In this most desperate hour, I cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win, and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour. While this campaign is coming to an end, our movement is not. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. reminded us that, \\u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\\u201d The fight for justice is what our campaign has been about, the fight for justice is what our movement remains about.\",\n",
